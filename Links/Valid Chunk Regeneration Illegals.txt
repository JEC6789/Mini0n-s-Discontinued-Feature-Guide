"COMPLICATED" OBTAINING METHODS:

Permanent Moving Blocks:
 + Wire a spicky piston to a repeating circuit,
 + Place whatever block you want (doesn't matter too much as Moving Blocks aren't visible) in front of the sticky piston,
 + Activate the repeating circuit,
 + Time it right so you exit out of the game just as the pison retracts or extends (this may take a few tries),
 + Rejoin the game,
 + If done correctly there will be nothing in front of the sticky piston and you wont be able to place blocks there.
 NOTE: During this you may also encounter invisible piston heads in the way of placing blocks! 
       To ensure you have the moving blocks, break the stick piston.
       If it's a moving block you should still not be able to place blocks in that spot.
       Also this is more likely to be successful when using ICR but this is for VCR soooo.....

Waterless Alive Coral Blocks:
 + Set up a long water stream ending on the border of an empty chunk (DO NOT LET THE WATER FLOW INTO THE CHUNK),
 + Place coral blocks into the empty chunk next to the think layer of flowing water so it stays alive,
 + Save & Quit then rejoin,
 + Break the coral blocks to empty the chunk again and remove the water source,
 + Save & Quit then rejoin and the coral blocks should stay alive without water.

Incomplete Block Transformations:
 - Dry Sponge & Concrete Powder Next To Water:
   + Set up a path for a long water stream ending on the border of an empty chunk,
   + Place dry sponge/concrete powder blocks into the empty chunk next to where the think layer of flowing water will be,
   + Save & Quit then rejoin,
   + Break the dry sponge/concrete powder blocks to empty the chunk again and add the water source so it flows ALMOST into the empty chunk,
   + Save & Quit then rejoin and the dry sponge/concrete powder blocks should stay the same whilst next to water.
 - Lava On Soul Soil Touching Blue Ice:
   + Set up lava that flows NEARLY into the empty chunk,
   + Place soul soil underneath the lava closest to the chunk border,
   + Place blue ice into the empty chunk so it touches the flowing lava,
   + The lava should turn into basalt (this is intentional),
   + Save & Quit then rejoin,
   + Break the blue ice then mine the basalt wait for the lava to flow back into where the basalt was,
   + Save & Quit then rejoin and the blue ice should've regenerated next to the lava without turning it into basalt.
