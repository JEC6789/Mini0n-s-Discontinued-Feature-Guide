______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**0.17.0.1 alpha (Android)**
> [!CAUTION]
> PDV: Hitting a Mob or getting hit by a mob will crash the game.

- Updating a world from **0.15.9** alpha to this version will overwrite biome data of chunks causing the biomes to change into a stripe pattern. This can cause Overworld mobs to spawn in the Nether.

**1.2.13.8 - 1.2.6.60**
> [!CAUTION]
> Block Pallet Corruption (BPC)is possible using downgrading from this version range but this could make your world unplayable, if you don't have a strong device. If you are stuck in the loading screen just force close minecraft and try again. Make sure to make backups
<br>
- Loading a world in 1.2.13.8 and downgrading to 1.2.6.60 will convert all sub-chunks with block in them (air excluded) into chunks with random blocks in them. This can spawn a lot of entities and tile entities so it will be extremely laggy. These chunks have a random block pallet and can create a lot of illegal formations, like nether wart on top of brewing stand, or illegal blocks such as Education Edition Blocks, and Creative placed Blocks
