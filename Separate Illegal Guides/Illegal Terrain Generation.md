***KEY WORDS***

**(Android)**: Android Exclusive Version
<br>
**(UBC)**: The process of downgrading a block to another version converting it to an Unknown Block, mining it up, and then upgrading to 1.21.30 to obtain the block
<br>
**(Experimental)**: Turning on the Experimental Toggle
<br>
**(X.XX.XX.X - Y.YY.YY.Y)**: Version Upgrading or Downgrading from and to 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**0.17.0.1 alpha (Android)**
> [!CAUTION]
> PDV: Hitting a Mob or getting hit by a mob will crash the game.

- Updating a world from **0.15.9** alpha to this version will overwrite biome data of chunks causing the biomes to change into a stripe pattern. This can cause Overworld mobs to spawn in the Nether.

**1.2.13.8 - 1.2.6.60**
> [!CAUTION]
> Block Pallet Corruption (BPC)is possible using downgrading from this version range but this could make your world unplayable, if you don't have a strong device. If you are stuck in the loading screen just force close minecraft and try again. Make sure to make backups
<br>
- Loading a world in 1.2.13.8 and downgrading to 1.2.6.60 will convert all sub-chunks with block in them (air excluded) into chunks with random blocks in them. This can spawn a lot of entities and tile entities so it will be extremely laggy. These chunks have a random block pallet and can create a lot of illegal formations, like nether wart on top of brewing stand, or illegal blocks such as Education Edition Blocks, and Creative placed Blocks

**1.16.40 - 0.6.0**
> [!Note]
> If your phone is crashing upon creating a world in 0.6.0, you can unzip the "Cross Dimension Chunk Template" zip file and move the extracted folder to "games > com.mojang > minecraftWorlds" Note: this may be considered cheating because it does require you to move world files
- You can get Cross Dimension Chunks (e.g. Overworld Chunks in the end/nether) by entering the end at these specific coordinates 115, 100, 149 in 1.16.40. Downgrade your client to 0.6.0 and create a world in 0.6.0 with the same seed as your 1.16.40 save. After loading the world, disconnect from the world and move the db folder of the 1.16.40 world to the 0.6.0 save. Once done upgrade back to 1.16.40 and change the world to infinite, it may crash but just reload minecraft and just try again.
