- Loading a world in 1.2.13.8 and downgrading to 1.2.6.60 will convert all sub-chunks with block in them (air excluded) into chunks with random blocks in them. This can spawn a lot of entities and tile entities so it will be extremely laggy. These chunks have a random block pallet and can create a lot of illegal formations, like nether wart on top of brewing stand, or illegal blocks such as Education Edition Blocks, and Creative placed Blocks
- Compound Creators can be waterlogged

**1.4.0**
- Putting a TNT on a string that is connected to tripwire hooks and blowing it up, it can create a tripwire hook ghost block. If you mine the ghost block at the same time a portal lights you have an oppurtunity to obtain a portal tile. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYYz6a0VyDQ
