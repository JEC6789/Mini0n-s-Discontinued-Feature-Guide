______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**0.2.0 alpha (Android)**
- Water, lava, fire, or snow could be replaced with Sugarcane, Cactus, and Ladders to create Cactus on grass, Sugarcane on Stone without water, or Floating Invisible Ladders. Due to the replacement of the block bypassing the initial update check, the blocks can be placed.

- Gravity Blocks like Sand or Gravel will not fall if a block is broken underneath them.
- Placing a Door on Farmland will remove the bottom half of the Door leaving the Top Half of the Door standing
- Tilling Dirt underwater will give you Underwater Farmland

**0.6.0 alpha (Android)**
- Placing a slab adjacent to the world border and attempting to place a block that needs support (e.g. torches, levers, ladders) on the side of the slab will place them on the world border. When updating the world to infinite this will give you floating torches, levers, or ladders

**0.8.0 alpha (Android)**
- Cacti can grow adjacent to blocks
- Placing Torches on the side of a block and placing a painting on the same block will overlap the painting and the torches

**0.8.0 build 1 (Android)**
- Block of Coal in this version and updating will change the block of coal to Nether Bricks allowing for Nether Bricks in the Furnace Fuel Slot by putting Block of Coal in the Furnace Fuel Slot.

**0.9.0 alpha (Android)**
<br>
> [!NOTE] To update an old world to an infinite world in this version will require file editing. This can be done by changing the "generator:0" value in the level.dat file to "generator:1". This will change the world to infinite.
- Furnaces that are generated in Villages in this version have a data value of 0 and have no visible face

**0.12.1 alpha (Android)**
- Placing a sponge underwater won't absorb the water

**0.17.0.1 alpha (Android)**

**1.2.11**
- Placing Daylight Sensor in the nether leaves them powered

**1.2.13.8 - 1.2.6.60**
> [!CAUTION]
> Block Pallet Corruption (BPC)is possible using downgrading from this version range but this could make your world unplayable, if you don't have a strong device. If you are stuck in the loading screen just force close minecraft and try again. Make sure to make backups
<br>
- Loading a world in 1.2.13.8 and downgrading to 1.2.6.60 will convert all sub-chunks with block in them (air excluded) into chunks with random blocks in them. This can spawn a lot of entities and tile entities so it will be extremely laggy. These chunks have a random block pallet and can create a lot of illegal formations, like nether wart on top of brewing stand, or illegal blocks such as Education Edition Blocks, and Creative placed Blocks
- Compound Creators can be waterlogged

**1.4.0**
- Putting a TNT on a string that is connected to tripwire hooks and blowing it up, it can create a tripwire hook ghost block. If you mine the ghost block at the same time a portal lights you have an oppurtunity to obtain a portal tile. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYYz6a0VyDQ

**1.5.0**
- Flowers, Saplings, and Dead Bushes can be waterlogged. Make sure to make the sapling a dark oak sapling so it doesn't update

**1.9.0**
- You can put Glass Bottles in a Brewing Stand via hopper

**1.14.0**
- Permanent Open Barrels can be made by pushing a Barrel via piston while opening it at the same time

**Beta 1.16.0.51**
- All Crimson and Warped Wood variants could be put into the fuel slot of Furnaces

**Beta 1.16.0.57**
- Treasure Bastions spawn with one Barrier Block in one of the lava pools

**1.16.1.2**
- You can exploit commands in this version by removing the space between the /give and the @ symbol. This will not turn off achievements allowing for commands in a vanilla world. This can give you infinite amount of illegals including bedrock, spawn eggs, top slabs, command blocks, and weird blocks in the furnace fuel slot. List of Illegals are in the "1.16.1.2 Guide" file in the "Links Folder". Using this glitch may be considered cheating but it relies on personal preference, some commands will be for sure considered cheating. 
- Giving yourself an item that has a durability bar and adding the metadata of 9999 will give you negative durability items. So using the /give@s netherite_sword 1 9999 will give you a negative durability netherite sword. Combining 4 of these negative durability items in a crafting recipe will give you an unbreakable item with almost infinite durability.
- Using the /execute command you can obtain a lot of other commands by using /execute@s ~ ~ ~ and then your command. Using this method with the /replaceitem command can give you many different items in the furnace output slot and many different items in mobs offhand.

**1.16.40**
- Pistons can extend below y-level 0
- Support Blocks can be placed on Chains
- Endermen can pick up warped and crimson fungus and place it down on any other block

**1.16.100**
- Placing an end gateway on the central pillar of the end fountain when the dragon perches, it will freeze the dragon. After relogging an end gateway will appear where the ender dragon was. This allows for over 20 end gateways in the main end island.

**1.16.220**
- Pushing a detector rail with a minecart on it, and breaking the minecart will give you a Permanently Powered Detector Rail
- Placing non-full blocks (e.g. Enchanting Tables, Slabs, Trapdoors) in snow-covered flowers, the flowers will won't break. This allows for flower-logged blocks.
- End Portals do not trigger Block updates. So by flower-logging the end portal frames and activating them below gravity blocks and then breaking the grass block underneath the end portals, the end portal frames will break leaving floating gravity blocks.
